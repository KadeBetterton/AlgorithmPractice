## Contents

| Filename                       | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `MaxSubarrayVariants.java`    | Implements brute force, prefix sum, and Kadane's algorithm to solve the maximum subarray problem. |
| `StackQueueArrayReversal.java`| Demonstrates the use of stacks and queues to reverse arrays and manipulate elements. |
| `ExpressionTreePostfix.java`  | Builds and traverses an expression tree from a postfix expression. |
| `BinarySearchTreeQueries.java`| Binary search tree with support for range queries and index-based selection. Requires "BinaryNode.java" |
| `QuicksortVariants.java`      | Multiple variants of quicksort: standard, median-of-three, and hybrid with insertion sort. |
| `FloydWarshallShortestPaths.java` | Computes all-pairs shortest paths using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. |
| `GreedyKnapsack.java`         | Solves the fractional knapsack problem using a greedy approach based on value-to-weight ratio. |
